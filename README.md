(8_))}-  High interaction Honeypot for WordPress.
  \_)   
```

The HoneyPress projects adds high interaction honeypot features to an existing WordPress instance. The project can be installed as a regular plugin and wiill monitor given actions on the WordPress instance. HoneyPress can allow users to be created or being used by a defined username and password list. Activities will be logged on the logs/ directory inside the WordPress directory.

The project heavily depends on WordPress hook and action, but can also monitor file modifications inside the Wordpress files itself.

## Obvious Disclaimer

ðŸ›‘ **This project is a playground. Use with caution :)** 
ðŸ›‘ This honeypot _de facto_ introduces a Security issue on purpose to the WordPress. Use in isolated environments only
ðŸ›‘ The honeypot itself might contain security issues

## Features

- [x] Logging of failed login interactions
- [x] Injecting of users into the instance for action tracking
- [x] Tracking of directory traversal attacts (with .htaccess redirect towards index.php)
- [x] Interception of xmlrpc calls
- [x] Timeout for sessions
- [x] FileSystem based logging
- [X] Proper deletion of honeypot users
- [x] Catching of file uploads inside WordPress
- [x] Monitoring of comments (spam)
- [x] Log activity inside the WP dashboard

## Activities

HoneyPress can monitor following actions

- `request` - A request was completed
- `dashboard` - A user navigated in the admin dashboad
- `usercleanup_timeout` - A user was removed (e. g. due session expire) by HoneyPress
- `useradd`/ `user_create` - A user was created by HoneyPress
- `usercleanup_logout`- A user was removed due to logout by HoneyPress
- `comment` - A comment was done
- `fileupload` - A file was uploaded out of the WordPress backend
- `filedropnew` - A file was dropped somewhere in the WordPress installation 1) 2)
- `filedropdelete` - A file was removed somewhere in the WordPress installation 1) 2)

### Remarks 
1) if a file was changed, a `filedropdelete` and `filedropnew` action will be caused.
2) not for wp-content/uploads

## Setup

Make sure not found files are being redirected to the index.php of the WordPress instance (allowing the plugin to catch these requests).

### Setup plugin

Place following `honeypress.json` in your WordPress root folder.

```
{
  "mask": true,
  "existingUsersOnly": false,
  "blockedLogins": [
    "admin"
  ],
  "generatorTag": "WordPress 5.721",
  "allowUploads": true,
  "expireUser": 10,
  "catchComments": true,
  "watchFiles": true,
  "userRole": "contributor",
  "logStyle": "json"
}
```
|Setting|Description|Default|
|---|---|--|
|mask|Hide the plugin behind "Hello Dolly"|true|
|existingUsersOnly|If only existing users should be allowed to be logged in|false|
|blockedLogins|(if existingUsersOnly = false) don't create/ use following users (e. g. admin)| array|
|generatorTag|The meta generator tag to be used|WordPress 5.7|
|allowUploads|if true, uploads will be allowed, if false not. In both cases uploads will be logged|true|
|expireUser|(if existingUsersOnly = false) delete the user `n` seconds after login|60|
|catchComments|Should comments be monitored|true|
|watchFiles|Check the files for changes (slow operation)|true|
|userRole|The default role to assign to new users. Must be existing.|contributor|
|logStyle|The log style. Can be either a flat log or JSON (`flat`, `json`)|json|

Install the HoneyPress plugin into WordPress. Make sure the "Hello Dolly" plugin is present. 

In case you give the default user role permission to access the plugin list, HoneyPress will try to mask itself behind Hello Dolly's description.

# Logging

The honeypot logs as following:

```
logs/global.log # all activity

logs/<token>/credentials.log (if the user logged in)
logs/<token>/<timestamp><request|dashboard|usercleanup|useradd|usercleanup_logout|fileupload|comment|filedropnew|filedropdelete>.log (Activity)
```

`global.log` uses following structure:

```
[IP] [token or "No token"] [request|dashboard|usercleanup|useradd|usercleanup_logout|fileupload|comment|filedropnew|filedropdelete] logmessage
```

## Limitations

- This honeypot utilizes hooks and filters offered by WordPress. It is clear that only a subset ov available events can be monitored.

- It is not the goal to monitor everything possible, it is more an base monitoring what is going on with some crawlers or botnets.

- A modified file will trigger an `filedropdelete` event, followed by a `filedropnew` event.

## Updating instances

- When having `watchFiles` enabled, remove the `pre.json` file after the wordpress update. The initial state will be recreated (otherwise all files might be marked as modified)

## Recommendations

- Use an proxy for outgoing connections (so you can monitor installed droppers)
- Use containers and/ or virtual machines
- Apply a regular reset of the WordPress instances
- Take caution when using the administrator role for new users
- ðŸ›‘ **Don't use this on a production environment** ðŸ›‘ 
- Prevent access throught the webserver towards `logs/` and `honeypress.json` (redirect it to 404)
- Implement a log rotation on `global.log`
